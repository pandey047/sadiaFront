            Pragma is a marketplace of highly rated services provider and
            matching them with the customers and providing the information about
            the process and level of resources available. Like dating and
            marriage, separation and divorce is a life changing experience but
            very unlike dating/marriage, couples growing apart can have a
            long-term negative impact on the couple involved as well as on their
            near and dear ones. Most couples seeking separation and divorce
            struggle with where to start and whom to turn to seek advise.
            Depending on who and where they turn to first can truly set the
            course for the entire journey that is filled with uncertainty of the
            process resulting in uninformed decisions that can be costly to the
            involved parties delivering suboptimal outcomes. Our mission is to
            develop a one-stop platform solution with relevant content, flexible
            for users to navigate and scalable to add additional content and
            services as we grow Pragma.
